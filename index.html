                            tinkering with physics. Aside from programming, I enjoy art, history, and playing video games.
                            I am incredibly excited to introduce others to world of programming and foster their understandings
                            in the subject area.</p>

                            interested in 3D graphics. When I'm not coding, you can find me playing Minecraft.</p>
