                    <p>Crocodile Coding is a tutoring organization founded by four high schoolers from the Bay Area.
                        We are dedicated to teaching children coding and inspiring them to pursue programming as a
                        passion.
                        We currently start with 4th to 8th grade students who are seeking to learn the rudiments of
                        computer science, and, in the future,
                        we will offer courses about further advanced concepts and languages such as Python and
                        JavaScript.
                        Our mission is to introduce children to the marvels of computer science and kindle their enthusiasm for
                        its applications.

                            tinkering with physics. Aside from programming, I enjoy art, history, and playing video games.
                            I am incredibly excited to introduce others to world of programming and foster their understandings

                            interested in 3D graphics. When I'm not coding, you can find me playing Minecraft.</p>
